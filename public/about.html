<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Myself Manvitha, currently studying Btech 3rd year in Electronics and communications engeneering.I am a 
  extrovert open for all kinds of oppurtunities that life gives and also a very quick learner.
  I am a part of two major clubs in my college.<br/>
  1.Apeksha - a coding club which helps juniors or freshers to have a quick and easy learning of coding using real life 
  problems and projects. It is a interative club between juniors and seniors and helps the freshers to have a good team of friends and connections
  that helps them further.<br/>
  2.Filmm technology club - A place where talent meets actions.This place not just encorages you to take side of your passion but also teaches you how to 
  conqur all the hudles you face through out your journey.People who has no prior knowledge but have passion were very heartly welcomed into this place where there
  are a lot of people to help them learn.<br>
  I personally like product photography and into User generated content(UGC) and trying to master few things related to that.
  This club recently conducted an International Film festival named "CHITRAMELA" and I have did my pary as CHEIF EVENTS, leading a team of 30+ studends.
  I aslo own a small business named "themjewels" through which I sell 92.5 silver jewellery using instagram. I have recently created a website for my small business and its currently in underbudding stage.

<p><h2>Why ECE?</h2>
My passion for learning new
  things and skills is the only reason for me to select ECE in btech and only that particular course can open up a door that has
  very vast set of oppurtunities in this real world senario where AI is taking over the man power.
<br>
But I've never stopped digging stuff related to software.I am currently learning web development and also headed to learn powerbi and ui/ux design.</p>
ECE gave me FREEDOM to persue whatever I want and whatever I really need.
